# iOS 13 Dark Mode Example

Announced at WWDC 2019, iOS 13  officially brings a system-wide dark mode to iPhone and iPad. There are three ways to make your app conform to automatically work with the system dark mode settings:
- Use UI Element colors that are contained in `UIColor`
- Use adaptive colors (new in iOS 13) contained in `UIColor`
- Create custom color assets that define colors for dark and light appearances

This example project shows how to implement all three methods.
